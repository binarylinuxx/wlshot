# wlshot
Simple screenshot utility for every possible wlr window manager or Desktop environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Desc
--------
I'm tired of using and combining grim and slurp, so I created my own script
that allows you to use one simple command.
> âš  **WARNING:** This utility is currently in **PRE-PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA**.
> Use it at your own risk and fear! The author takes no responsibility for any issues or damage caused.

## Example options and usage:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First time it might look not easy to use but it's veeery simple:
```
wlshot [screen|region] wlrclipboard=[1|0]
```
If you choose screen it captures the screen output if region it captures a selected space on
screen. About wlrclipboard: if you set that as 0 value it saves the screenshot as .png file;
if you set value as 1 it autocopies to clipboard.

You can use:
```
-h or --help
```
as flag to get help message.
